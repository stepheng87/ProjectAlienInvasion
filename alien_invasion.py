#In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears 
#at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
#right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
#spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
#and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
#destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet 
#appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
#the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
#loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
